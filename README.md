# To-Do-list
This To-Do list interface is designed to provide users with an online platform for managing their scheduled tasks for a specific day.
I have used HTML for structuring the content on my To-Do-list interface, 
            CSS for a good appearance and 
            Javascript for handling the interactivity within the UI and the user.
